### API
Messages: A list and not a stack since i need list operations and IDs. Stacks would have been interesting because of its LIFO principle, which would solve the reverse chronological order. However, i need to be able to view all messages and not just the last one. If stack were to be used, I would have to pop and push a lot, which would take much time and energy -> not a very effective program.

responses for messages:
- it is allowed for anyone to send anyone a message. Were this a realife scenario, it should be possible to block other useres. Since this is not a requirement, this will not be added. 
- should messages have a bad respons? ever messsage should be able to be sent?

a message needs to be connected to a conversationID and a conversationID needs to be connected to conversations.
