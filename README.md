# WASAText
This is the exam project in the course Web and software architecture. In this project i will: 
1. define APIs using the OpenAPI standard
2. design and develop the server side (“backend”) inGo
3. design and develop the client side (“frontend”) in JavaScript 
4.  create a Docker container image for deployment



## Reasoning
### API
#### getMyConversations
No other responses than 200 for getMyConversations. If this was a realistic application, it would be wise to add 4xx codes in regards to not logged in users. This is not a requierment in the task description and is therefor left out.
